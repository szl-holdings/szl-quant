# szl-quant receipt ledger

Append-only DSSE receipt ledger written by the `scheduled-paper` workflow.
Every file is an advisory **paper-only** decision receipt, ed25519-signed by the
engine identity pinned at `keys/engine_pubkey.json` on `main`.

Verify any entry independently:
```
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --dir ledger/<run-dir>/
```

Runs recorded: 8 · receipts: 65 (MEASURED from files present; cron is best-effort, gaps are honest)

Track record (latest, MEASURED from verified receipts only): +1d n=0 hit=— pending=0 · +7d n=0 hit=— pending=0 · no-calls(BLOCKED)=31 — a past frequency, NOT a prediction

Hash chain: 6 link(s), head seq 6 sha256 5321fca0578b… — every sealed run tamper-evident; walk it: `node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --chain ledger/`
