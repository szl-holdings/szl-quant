# szl-quant receipt ledger

Append-only DSSE receipt ledger written by the `scheduled-paper` workflow.
Every file is an advisory **paper-only** decision receipt, ed25519-signed by the
engine identity pinned at `keys/engine_pubkey.json` on `main`.

Verify any entry independently:
```
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --dir ledger/<run-dir>/
```

Runs recorded: 10 · receipts: 86 (MEASURED from files present; cron is best-effort, gaps are honest)

Track record (latest, MEASURED from verified receipts only): +1d n=0 hit=— pending=0 · +7d n=0 hit=— pending=0 · no-calls(BLOCKED)=39 — a past frequency, NOT a prediction

Hash chain: 8 link(s), head seq 8 sha256 bf6cdb176cf0… — every sealed run tamper-evident; walk it: `node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --chain ledger/`

Paper book (MODELED, paper-only — NOT real funds): seq 2 · equity $10000.000000 · open positions 0 · fills this run 0 · replay it: `node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --book ledger/`

Refusal record (MEASURED): latest run BLOCKED 4/6 — conviction×2 liquidity×2 · lifetime (recorded runs) 4/6 — conviction×2 liquidity×2 · a refusal is a decision, not an absence · replay: `node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --refusals ledger/`
