> ## Honest scope box — read this first
> **Advisory research system. PAPER ONLY. NOT financial advice.**
> This engine emits *signed research signals* and keeps a *simulated* paper
> book. There is **no order execution, no exchange/wallet integration, no
> custody** — those code paths do not exist. Backtest results are
> **MEASURED replays of real history** and predict nothing. Λ conviction
> roll-ups are **ADVISORY** (Λ uniqueness = Conjecture 1, open). Confidence
> is capped at the **0.97 trust ceiling** — nothing here reaches certainty,
> by law.

## Why this exists

Solana "calls" accounts post unverifiable, hindsight-editable wins.
Serious systematic shops publish methodology and warn about backtest
overfitting. `szl-quant` takes the leaders' lessons and rebuilds them in
SZL's shape (see [docs/RESEARCH_MEMO.md](docs/RESEARCH_MEMO.md)): **the
differentiator is verifiable trading provenance** — every signal, backtest
and paper session is wrapped in a DSSE envelope (spec-exact PAE, ed25519,
in-toto v1 Statement) at emission time, so cherry-picking and post-hoc
editing are cryptographically impossible, and every risk-gate rejection is
an honest **BLOCKED** verdict inside the signed record.

## Pipeline

```

                            verify/verify.mjs (independent, offline)
```

The engine's feedback loop runs inside an **ouroboros bounded loop**: each
observe→signal→gate→account cycle charges **loop tax** against a governance
budget; an exhausted ledger BLOCKS further emission (`budgetExhausted` is an
honest exit, not a failure to hide).

## Quickstart

```bash
# no dependencies — Node ≥ 20, stdlib only (everything vendored, no runtime CDNs)
npm test                      # 36 unit tests: doctrine invariants, DSSE, gates, determinism, ingest fallback, track record, hash chain, paper book

node bin/quant.mjs backtest   # MEASURED walk-forward backtests on real public history
node bin/quant.mjs paper      # one live paper session (REPORTED feeds) → signed signals

# independent verification (imports nothing from src/):
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --dir receipts/
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --chain ledger/  # walk the tamper-evident hash chain
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --book  ledger/  # REPLAY the stateful paper book
```

Feeds down? The engine emits an **honest empty** (`UNAVAILABLE`, zero
signals, still signed) — it never synthesizes a number.

## What a receipt proves — and what it does NOT

- ✅ **Authorship + integrity + time-of-emission binding**: ed25519 over
  spec-exact PAE; subject digest pins the exact canonical decision bytes;
  keyid = sha256(SPKI)[:16] (house convention; pin `keys/engine_pubkey.json`).
- ✅ **Honest verdicts**: a BLOCKED decision is signed as BLOCKED — there is
  no code path that flips it.
- ❌ It does **NOT** prove the signal is *good*. MEASURED backtests describe
  the past; nothing here claims predictive performance.
- ❌ It does **NOT** upgrade advisory Λ to proven trust — `provenTrust` is
  structurally locked `false` (govsign pattern).

## Autonomous receipt ledger

The [`scheduled-paper` workflow](.github/workflows/scheduled-paper.yml) runs
a paper session roughly every 6 hours, independently re-verifies the fresh
receipts against the pinned pubkey, and appends them to the
[`ledger` branch](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-quant/tree/ledger) —
an append-only public record that grows without anyone touching it.

- Verify any entry offline:
  `node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --dir ledger/<run-dir>/`
- GitHub cron is best-effort: **gaps are honest** — the ledger MEASURES what
  actually ran; it promises nothing.
- Feeds down ⇒ the run still lands an honest-empty session receipt
  (UNAVAILABLE, zero signals) — silence is never dressed up as activity.
- The CI signing key is a repo Actions secret; if it is absent the job
  **fails closed** rather than emit a single unsigned entry.

## Hash-chained ledger — deletion becomes visible

Every scheduled run seals its receipts into a signed **chain receipt**:
sha256 of every file in the run dir, plus the sha256 of the previous
chain receipt's bytes. Genesis (seq 1) backfilled every pre-chain run, so
the whole history is locked from the first link. Walk it yourself:

```bash
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --chain ledger/
```

Rewriting or deleting ANY sealed run now breaks the chain at that link.
Honest limit, stated plainly: wholesale deletion of the newest link(s)
(head truncation) is not detectable by the chain alone — GitHub Actions
run logs (each run's summary now carries the headline facts) and the git
history of INDEX.md act as external witnesses.

## Stateful paper book — a fund you can replay

```bash
node bin/quant.mjs book --ledger ledger/    # → signed book_*.receipt.json
node verify/verify.mjs --pubkey keys/engine_pubkey.json --book ledger/
```

From genesis onward, every scheduled run advances a cross-run **paper
book**: entries at 10% of equity on `ALLOWED ENTER_LONG`, full exits on
`ALLOWED EXIT_LONG`, MODELED bps costs, no leverage / pyramiding /
shorting — and anything BLOCKED leaves the book untouched (the gates
hold the book, fail closed).

The differentiator: the verifier does not *check* the book, it
**replays** it — every fill, state and mark is recomputed from the
DSSE-verified signal receipts alone, and byte-exact agreement is
required. Each receipt pins its predecessor by sha256, config is locked
at genesis, gaps are declared in-band, unpriced positions yield an
honest `null` equity instead of an invented mark. Paper only — the
equity is MODELED over REPORTED marks, never real funds, never a
performance claim.

## Verifiable track record — the anti-"calls account"

```bash
node bin/quant.mjs track --ledger ledger/   # → signed trackrecord_*.receipt.json
```

Scores every past signal against what the market actually did next — and
the scoreboard is itself a DSSE-signed receipt:

- inputs are **verified receipts only**, checked against the pinned
  pubkey; tampered/unsigned files are excluded **by name** in the report;
- **full population**: BLOCKED no-calls are counted, never hidden — the
  engine's refusals are part of its record;
- realized forward returns are **MEASURED**, baseline and outcome from ONE
  source series (sha256-pinned); not-yet-elapsed horizons are honest
  UNAVAILABLE "pending" entries — never guessed, never dropped;
- hit-rate is a **past frequency, not a prediction**, and carries an
  in-band weak-evidence note until n ≥ 10;
- the scheduled ledger run regenerates it every ~6h, so the `ledger`
  branch INDEX always shows the current honest scoreboard.

An X "calls account" can delete its misses. This one cryptographically
cannot: every call is signed at emission, and the scoreboard only counts
what verifies.

## Resilient history ingest

Daily history tries **CoinGecko public** (USD) first; if it fails (the
shared public tier throttles hard), the engine falls back to **Coinbase
Exchange public candles** (genuine USD quotes). Both are external feeds ⇒
**REPORTED**. The receipt's dataset block pins the serving source, URL,
sha256 of the exact series bytes, and a `sourceChain` recording every
attempt. One series, one source — stitching is forbidden. Both down ⇒
**UNAVAILABLE**, fail closed. (Binance was evaluated and rejected for
this role: HTTP 451 geo-restriction from US egress, where both dev and
CI runners live — a fallback that cannot fire is not resilience.)

## Formula-canon honesty

The locked-proven canonical set is **EXACTLY 8**: `{F1, F4, F7, F11, F12,
F18, F19, F22}` (machine-enforced upstream in
[lutar-lean](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean)). The mapping of
this engine's local implementations onto those F-ids is **NOT asserted**
(UNKNOWN — never fabricated), and the engine never claims its signals are
"proven". Λ = Conjecture 1, never "theorem".
